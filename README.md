### Project description
<a name="description"></a>

Create a responsive sidebar with toggle in javascript.


### Technical information
<a name="technical"></a>

In this project we have two developments.
1) The first is called "Easy way": it has a toggle() method inside the 'addEventListener' and a remove() method for classLists.
2) The second is called "Manual way": inside the 'addEventListener' we add or remove the '.show-sidebar' class with the if() condition.

It'is fully responsive. You can test how it behaves on both Desktop and Mobile.
